# Greenheck-Innovation-Expo-2019
Ben Paulson and Ryan Wojcik 2019 project entered into the Greenheck Innovation Expo.

This project called for a high school team to innovate a particular fan controller to one of two potential customers. Through this, teams were expected to meet the minimum requirements of ensuring their new fan controller worked, but also was cost effective and answered the customer's problem in a clever way.

With our project, we decided to meet the problems of a customer who wanted a high-tech fan system that gave them better control of the system. To answer this, each fan controller contains an Arduino MKR1010 board that allows the system to communicate over the internet, controlling the electricity that flows through the panel the fan controller controls. An Android app was then made for a more user-friendly experience.

This project was then presented to a board of judges with a presentation and live demonstration at the 2019 Greenheck Innovation Expo competition.
